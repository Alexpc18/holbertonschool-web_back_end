NoSQL, which stands for "Not Only SQL," is a term used to describe a wide range of database management systems that don't strictly adhere to the traditional relational database model. Instead of using tables with rows and columns like SQL databases, NoSQL databases employ various data models, such as key-value stores, document stores, wide-column stores, or graph databases.
