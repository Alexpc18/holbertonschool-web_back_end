ES6 introduced powerful data manipulation features like map, filter, and reduce, which allow concise and efficient handling of arrays and objects. These methods enable transforming, filtering, and aggregating data with minimal code, promoting cleaner and more readable functional programming patterns in JavaScript applications. They enhance productivity by simplifying common data operations without the need for traditional loops.
